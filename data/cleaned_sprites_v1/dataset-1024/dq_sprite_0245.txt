A large bird with brown and white feathers, an orange beak, and purple eyes is captured in mid-flight with its wings spread and legs tucked in. The bird's wings are angled upwards and outwards, with darker brown feathers on the edges. Its sharp expression is emphasized by its pointed beak and wide eyes.
